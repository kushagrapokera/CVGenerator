# CV Generator

## Overview
CV Generator is a Django-based web application that allows users to create, store, and download professional resumes in PDF format. The application features a form for users to input their details, a database for storing multiple profiles, and a list view to access or download stored resumes.

## Features
- **Form Submission**: Users can fill out a form with their details, including name, email, phone, education, skills, and work experience.
- **Profile Storage**: All submitted profiles are stored in a database.
- **PDF Generation**: Resumes are generated in PDF format using `pdfkit` and `wkhtmltopdf`.
- **Resume List**: A page listing all stored profiles with options to download resumes.

### Key Files
- `views.py`: Contains the main logic for handling requests and generating PDFs.
- `models.py`: Defines the `Profile` model for storing user data.
- `templates/`: Contains the HTML templates for rendering pages.
- `urls.py`: Maps URLs to views.

## Configuration

### Setting Up wkhtmltopdf
Update the `resume` view in `views.py` with the correct path to `wkhtmltopdf`:
```python
config = pdfkit.configuration(wkhtmltopdf=r'C:\path\to\wkhtmltopdf.exe')
```

### Updating Database
If you modify the `Profile` model, apply migrations to update the database schema:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## Dependencies
- Django
- pdfkit
- wkhtmltopdf
- Bootstrap

## Future Enhancements
- Add authentication for profile management.
- Support multiple resume templates.
- Provide options to customize PDF styles.

## Troubleshooting
- **PDF Generation Error**: Ensure `wkhtmltopdf` is correctly installed and configured.
- **Static Files Not Loading**: Confirm Bootstrap is linked properly in the templates.
